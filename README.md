# Introduction
This project was undertaken as part of a university assignment by a team of three individuals. The program calculates the square root of 2 and provides options to display the result in either decimal or hexadecimal representation. Additionally, it offers different versions of the algorithm for square root calculation and allows performance measurement with various repetitions.

## Usage Options

`-V`: Choose the version of the program. Options range from 0 to 4. See the help section for details on each version.

`-B`: Measure the time it takes to produce a result with an optional argument specifying the number of repetitions.

`-d`: Return the square root result in decimal representation. Specify the number of decimal places with an optional argument.

`-h` : Return the square root result in hexadecimal representation. Specify the number of hexadecimal places with an optional argument.

`-t` : Test the result against an optional input string. If no argument is provided, compare the calculated result to the correct decimal string (up to 10 million digits).

`-h` or `--help`: Display the help message.


## Versions

Version 0: Exponentiation by squaring with long-array data structures and SIMD.

Version 1: Self-developed algorithm for exponentiation with long-array data structures.

Version 2: Exponentiation by squaring with int-array data structures.

Version 3: Self-developed algorithm for exponentiation with int-array data structures.

Version 4: Exponentiation by squaring with long-array data structures without SIMD.
